Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This is my very first project using HTML and CSS - It was my first time creating something outside of a tutorial and I'm quite happy with how it turned out!

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

# Looking Back
- This was my first time using grid to create a layout - I couldn't figure out how to center vertically, so I ended up creating extra rows and columns, then setting up grid areas and assigning my content to the middle areas. Looking back, all it would've taken is a wrapper set as display grid with align-items:center, but since this solution works I decided to leave it as is.
- It completely slipped my mind to leave comments in the code. Luckily there isn't anything particularly complicated in there, but this is definitely not a habit to pick up!
- I probably should've put the image in the html instead of using a background image in css for accessibility. The way it currently is, there is no alt tag on the image since it's a background image.
- I did not yet know about custom properties when I made this - That would've come in handy since I'm reusing some of the colors.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
